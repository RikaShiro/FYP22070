progress for this week.
finally found a node.js module that is similar to mitmproxy and successfully decode majsoul messaages in "notify" type
notify type can almost fulfill our requirements. but without 1 thing: player id

1. GitHub ssh key problem (can git clone, but cannot push code)
2. project url on gitee.com: https://gitee.com/wu-xianzhe/http-mitmproxy
