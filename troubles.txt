1. cannot install pytorch CUDA11.6
solution: uninstall python3.11 and install python3.10
2. cannot find "import module torch"
3. OSError: The paging file is too small for this operation to complete.
solved in github issue# 1036
4. torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory.
Tried to allocate 400.00 MiB (GPU 0; 2.00 GiB total capacity; 802.77 MiB already allocated; 225.74 MiB free; 882.00 MiB reserved in total by PyTorch)
If reserved memory is >> allocated memory try setting max_split_size_mb to avoid fragmentation.
See documentation for Memory Management and PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF
solution
  set batch size as 1
  3.1. RuntimeError: indices should be either on cpu or on the same device as the indexed tensor (cpu)
  solution give up GPU. uninstall all the pip packages and reinstall things
  3.2. AssertionError: Torch not compiled with CUDA enabled
