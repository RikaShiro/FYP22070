finally solve the troubles in github push. 2 reasons
1. should use port 443 instead of default port 22 when communicating with github server in SSH
solution: write in ~/.ssh/config
2. should use RSA4096 instead of the recommended ed25519 algorithm to generate ssh keys
solution: delete all previous keys and generate use RSA

now I am using https://github.com/Pear-White/FYP22070 as the working repository
it's private because I am afraid of plagarism check in case someone may copy my code after I make it open source
the invitation link is TODO
also https://gitee.com/wu-xianzhe/fyp22070 is the backup repository

progress for this week.
finally found a node.js module that is similar to mitmproxy and successfully decode majsoul messaages in "notify" type
notify type can almost fulfill our requirements. but without 1 thing: player id

1. GitHub ssh key problem (can git clone, but cannot push code)
2. project url on gitee.com: https://gitee.com/wu-xianzhe/http-mitmproxy
	click the url to view the private repository (valid in 3 days): https://gitee.com/wu-xianzhe/http-mitmproxy/invite_link?invite=13d32b5a8120e268c7f02c728402e2bee2afc3a07f99c4ccb7993663152babc51611f64ef7b4b32d5f318cd36bbddc3a
	or wait util I solve the github problem
3. chrome extension development
4. get player id to match seatlist
	best solution：decode things in .lq.lobby
	or：force the user start an AI game first
5. start FYP webpage (wordpress)
