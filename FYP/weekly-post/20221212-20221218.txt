1. calculate shanten number for 3k+2 tiles (2, 5, 8, 11, 14)
there are 1292059 cases in total
an implementation of zhihu article https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/31000381
why calculate shanten number for 14 instead of 13?
-- it helps to give recommendations. if calculate 4k+1 shanten number instead, it's hard to suggest next draw

2.  integrate shanten number and websocket

todo
1. recognize dora indicator
2. recognize chiponkang?
3. find a proper threshold. 0.85 seems a little bit too high.
sometimes it fails to recognize the tiles
4. special cases for 7 pairs and 13 orphans 

toubles
1. how to determine the setTimeout delay when getting screenshot
we listen to websocket messages and do something when "ActionDealTile" is received
when we have 14 tiles in hand, we call the parser to calculate the shanten number
the time may be diff on diff devices
or even diff when CPU is occupied by other processes (idk)

2. cannot differentiate 5 man/pin/sou and aka dora 5 man/pin/sou
since template matching method is using grayscale.
idk if it works for colored pictures

3. it's hard to recognize discarded tiles because they are not arranged neatly

4. works only in 1920*1080 resolution
