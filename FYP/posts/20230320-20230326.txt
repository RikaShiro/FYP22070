progresses
1. switch to Node 16.19.1 LTS. no longer use the latest Node 18
2. add initialize.js to guide the user setup
3. update all node packages using npm-check-updates
4. fix errors in index.js brought by the update of "http-mitm-proxy"
5. update opencv.js and liqi.json, together with the majsoul game update
6. add readme.md for github display
7. initialize extension directory

problems
1. slient mode of "http-mitm-proxy" was removed. now the proxy prints a lot of useless logs for web events.
2. using require() to execute other js files in current js files seems to have problems. it will not wait until the require() script ends.

todo
1. find someway to automatically install "http-mitm-proxy" SSL cerificate. currently it has to be installed by users manually.
